# FakeBank
An small bank/store type of program. (No actual money being deposited or withdrawn). Meant to be used with a bar-code reader.
If the app fails at any point make sure that the directory "C:\Users\Public\Documents" exists and that it has access to it.
(↓IF YOU HAVE A BARCODE READER↓)
Create a bar-code(find a barcode creator on google) and use that one as your "Credit Card Number" and print it and use it like a "Credit Card". 
Then add items to the store with their bar-code / price.

IF U WANT TO TEST go to debug and find the exe and download it. OR feel free to modify it to your own version.
